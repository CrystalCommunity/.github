# Crystal Community
We welcome all visitors! This organization is primarily intended for players as a guide. **Crystal Community** is probably the first thing that comes to mind of our minecraft server, but it actually includes the whole community. What exactly does this **__community__** include?

- **Online Game Servers:** The main topic of the community is about the Minecraft server, but in addition to these, you can expect other online game servers, which will mostly be decided by the players.

- **Websites:** We try to use as unique and stylish websites as possible, we do not use a pre-made template. Websites include our *community pages*, *online stores*, *information pages*, *etc...*
  
- **Our E-Sport team:** (Niko Posa's task)

- **Team and colleagues:** Within the community, we place great emphasis on ensuring that everyone can work in a friendly and familiar environment. That is why it is very important to be respectful and informed and, most importantly, to have a good time!

- **Educating** One of our plan is to help others learn how to make a minecraft JAVA plugin. It can be a really good advantages if you want to learn coding and we will help you earn a basic knowledge.

  
## Our plans 🛣️
- Creating and maintaining a friendly community
